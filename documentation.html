    <h2> Objective and Target Audience</h2>
    <div>
         <p>
        This website serves to encourage the exchange of culture, build understanding between people and promote the value of diversity. Especially in this time of the refugee crisis where there is a mass migration, this site hopefully will help connect locals with newly resettled refugees in the area. Having carefully thought about the implications of the approach of volunteering to help a refugee, the decision was made to have a completely different approach to helping refugees. This site hopes to connect refugees and locals in a meaningful way where friendships can start and from there, cultivate a culture of helping refugees. 
        
        It basically allows people to join their closest community group and engage with others very personally. Through this application, users have the access to  reach others with the similar interest of protectng culture and promoting diveristy. After registering as a member of the community, users can begin to suggest and post their own fun community engagement activities in order to reach out to others and bond with them.  
    </p>
    </div>
    
    <h2> Design and Aesthetics  </h2>
    <div><p>
        The design and aesthetics of this website has been thought to be very simplistic and hopeful about the future. Clean and uncluttered layout give a professional feel to the website and therefore develop a kind of trust with users that decides to use this application. Pastel color especially skyblue in the logo was selected to represent the sky where things are filled with hope and positivity.  Other aspect of the design is in the content, the main content, which is the board of activities were placed strategically on the main page to give user a sense of the interface before choosing to register. And the incentive to register is that user that add their own posts to the board, which is why that comes in a separate page. 
    </p>
    </div>

    <h2>Client-Side User Interactivity</h2>
    <div><p>
        When thinking about this aspect of the website, I imagined how I would go through it myself. That was very helpful in the sense that I was able to rethink what was needed in the navigation bar on each page. One feature that I pushed for was to have the logo of the page be a navigator back to the main page, just like many other sites we com across out there. Because it is such a common thing in terms of user interactivity, I decided to have it in my website as well. All other aspects, users can interact and navigate the website very easily. 
         
    </p>
    </div>
     
    <h2>Information Exchange with the Server</h2>
    <div><p> There are two main parts to information exchange with the server on this website. First one can be seen on the main page where the activity posts is retrieved from the database dynamically. Then, on the side, this website also does information exchange with the server for user's register their information to join the community. There are one database with two tables for this website. 
    </p>
    </div>
     
    <h2> Operations Performed on the Server</h2>
    <div>
    <p> Operations performed on the server are found throughout the website. On the main page, users have the option to select the number of posts to dislplay and also to filter through cetegories. Here is where the website interacts wit the server to perform these information exchange operations. In loging in, the website is retrieving information from the data base on the server to check if user has been registered. Once user is logged in, users can submit a post to the board. And there, the website is also connecting with the server to get the user's name and email from the database in order to add information into the other database. 
    </p>
